                            Like docker, data science and data analysis are major blindspots of mine.  So I'm giving myself homework.

                            Choose a public dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository) and perform exploratory data analysis 
                            on it. This project could include data cleaning, summarization, and visualization to find patterns or insights.

                        <p>
                            A simple web browser that can render HTML pages, handle basic navigation (back, forward), and manage bookmarks. 
                            Goal: understand the fundamentals of how browsers work.
